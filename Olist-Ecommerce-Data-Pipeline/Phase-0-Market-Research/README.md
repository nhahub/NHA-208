📄 README – Phase 0: Market Research & Business Understanding
🧩 Overview

This phase focuses on understanding the business model of the Olist e-commerce marketplace, identifying stakeholder needs, defining required KPIs, and listing the business questions that the analytical dashboard should answer.
The goal is to ensure that all technical work (ETL, modeling, dashboarding) is aligned with real business objectives.

🛒 1. Understanding the Olist Marketplace Model

Olist is a Brazilian online marketplace connecting:

Customers (buyers)

Sellers (SMEs using Olist to sell online)

Logistics partners (shipping carriers)

Payment intermediaries

Olist enables sellers by providing:

Product listing & marketplace visibility

Customer acquisition

Order processing & tracking

Payment handling

Shipment coordination

This creates a multi-sided ecosystem generating data across sales, customers, orders, payments, logistics, and returns — making it an ideal candidate for end-to-end data analysis.

🎯 2. Purpose of This Phase

Before building any pipeline or dashboard, we needed to define:

What the business wants to measure

Which KPIs matter

What data we need

What decisions our insights will support

This ensures the entire project is business-driven, not just technically correct.

❓ 3. Core Business Questions

These are the key questions decision-makers need answered:

How do sales perform across time and product categories?

What are the best-performing sellers and regions?

What is the return rate, and which products drive most returns?

What is the average delivery time vs. estimated time?

What is the distribution of payment methods?

How many customers are repeat buyers vs. new buyers?

What is the customer retention rate?
