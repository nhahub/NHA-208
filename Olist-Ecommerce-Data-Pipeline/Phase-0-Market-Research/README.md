📄 README – Phase 0: Market Research & Business Understanding

🧩 Overview
This phase focuses on understanding the business model of the Olist e-commerce marketplace, identifying stakeholders’ needs, defining the required KPIs, and listing the business questions that the analytical dashboard should answer.
The goal is to ensure that all technical work (ETL, modeling, dashboarding) is aligned with real business objectives.

🛒 1. Understanding the Olist Marketplace Model
Olist is a Brazilian online marketplace platform that connects:
Customers (buyers)
Sellers (small and medium businesses)
Delivery and logistics partners
Payment gateways and financial intermediaries
Olist acts as an enabler providing:
Product listing and visibility
Customer acquisition
Order processing
Payment handling
Shipment coordination with carriers

This creates a multi-sided ecosystem, which requires analytics to monitor performance, customer behavior, operational efficiency, and revenue generation.

🎯 2. Purpose of This Phase
Before building any database, pipeline, or dashboard, we needed to clarify:
What the business is trying to measure
What success looks like
What KPIs are essential
What questions decision-makers need answered
What data sources are required

This Market Research phase ensures that the data pipeline is built with the correct logic and the dashboard delivers meaningful insights.

❓ 3. Core Business Questions
During the analysis, we identified key business questions such as:
How do sales perform across categories, months, and customer segments?
Which regions generate the highest revenue and profit?
What is the return rate, and which products contribute the most to returns?
What is the average shipping time vs. estimated time?
What are the top-performing sellers and products?
What is the distribution of payment methods used?
What is the customer retention rate and repeat purchase behavior?

📊 4. Key KPIs Identified
To answer the business questions effectively, we defined a list of KPIs including:
Sales & Financial KPIs
Total Sales
Total Profit
Average Order Value (AOV)
Opportunity Loss (due to returns)
Customer KPIs
Unique Customers
Repeat Customers
Customer Retention Rate
